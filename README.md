## Overview
<img src="../poke-info/src/assets/images/pokedex-api-overview.png" alt="Imagem exemplo">

> The project is a website which consumes the public Pok√©mon API, listing each one pok√©mon in cards, being possible to access a page with details. It's possible to navigate through pages, and there's a theme-toggler system.

### Description

Users should be able to:

- Scroll through pok√©mon's 50 at a time, according to the Pok√©dex Order;
- See a image, name and pok√©dex ID of the pok√©mon on cards;
- When clicking the "Show more" button, it should load 50 more pok√©mon;
- Change between "Dark" and "Light" themes;
- When clicking any card, navigate to the pok√©mon details page;
- Navigate to prev and next pok√©mon inside of the pok√©mon details page.
- See the pok√©mon's stats, abilities and moves when in the pok√©mon details page.

### Features

The project has some interesting features to enhance the user's experience like:

- A search filter feature;
- A type filter that works together with the search filter;
- A theme toggler button;
- Dynamic stat bars at the pok√©mon details page;
- And more!

## Challenges and Learning

### Otimizating API fetches with Axios and organizating the fetches' responses:

- About the API fetches, i dedicated some time to otimizate the responses, only storing informations i'd use in the responses as an object.

### Making the filters work together:

 - In this project i did learn how to make the search filter and the type filter work together, using a variable to store the value of the filters and then passing these values as props to the pokemon list.

### Using JS code in the styled-components:

- I used the styled-components library to style most of the page, and i had to use JS code within the styles to, for example, turn the pokemons' stats bar colors dynamic.
